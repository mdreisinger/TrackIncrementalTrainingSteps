Track Incremental Training Steps (TITS)

The goal of this app is for users to be able to:
1. easily enter workout data as they go.
2. easily view historic workout data to help inform their training choices.


An example of the data is as follows:
```
Date: 2021-07-15
Exercise: Deadlift
Sets: 3	
Reps: 10
Weight: 315
Rest: 60
Notes: "Felt week"
```

Note: if an exercise is not completed (e.g. your goal was 3 sets of 10 but on the last set you only got 8), then the data entries should be split up so that the data is accurate (e.g. first entry is 2x10 and second entry is 1x8). 

As the data is added, the order of entries is kept track of so that the user is able to see which order the exercises were completed in. The order can be editted by the user after it is added as well if necessary.
